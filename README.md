### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) - CSS-JS Tool

### What I learned

-Use of arbitrary properties with Tailwind CSS
-Manage states with Axios Hooks library
-Context, useContext and useMemo hook

### Continued development

Improve accessibility and semantic HTML for a better experience.

### Useful resources

- [Article about React Context and Hook guide](https://www.savaslabs.com/blog/using-react-global-state-hooks-and-context#spanspanspanstrongspanspan4-create-an-objectspanspanstrongspanspanspan) - With this I learned about the manage of context, passed values and useContext hook in child components.
